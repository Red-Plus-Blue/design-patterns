# Design Patterns
Implementations of software design patterns in various languages.

The goal is to include the classic 22 patterns from the GoF and modern patterns (as they fit with each particular language).
I will also include coding styles (like Fluent Interface) and architectures (like Model-View-Controller) as time and language permit.
